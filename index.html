            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Luis Noguera, and Iâ€™m from Palma de Mallorca. I am currently a third-year Artificial Intelligence student at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. I have a deep passion for technology and problem-solving, which aligns perfectly with my academic background and career goals.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy staying updated with the latest tech trends, working on personal projects, and exploring new places. I'm always eager to learn and grow both personally and professionally.</p>
            <p>Aside from my academic and professional interests, I am actively involved in various community service activities, such as volunteering at local shelters and participating in environmental conservation projects. These experiences have greatly contributed to my personal growth and understanding of societal issues.</p>
            <p>I am also an avid reader, with a keen interest in genres ranging from science fiction to historical non-fiction. This hobby has significantly enhanced my analytical and critical thinking skills.</p>
            <p>Traveling is another passion of mine. Exploring new cultures and meeting people from diverse backgrounds has broadened my horizons and instilled in me a deep appreciation for global diversity and inclusivity.</p>
