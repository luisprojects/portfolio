        <p>This classic Snake game was seamlessly integrated into this website by AI in less than one minute, showcasing the power and efficiency of modern technology. Enjoy the game and see how long you can grow your snake!</p>
        <p><strong>How to Play:</strong> Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the snake. The goal is to eat the food that appears on the screen. Each time the snake eats the food, it grows longer. The game ends if the snake runs into itself. In this version, the snake wraps around the edges of the screen, so it never hits the walls.</p>
